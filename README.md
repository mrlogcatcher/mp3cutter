An online MP3 cutter web project on GitHub is typically a web-based application designed to allow users to upload MP3 audio files, select a portion of the audio, and cut it to create a smaller MP3 file. Below is a general description of what such a project could involve:

Project Description
The Online MP3 Cutter Web Project allows users to trim or cut sections of an MP3 audio file. This is particularly useful for creating ringtones, shortening audio tracks, or isolating specific parts of a longer file. The project might include:

Key Features:
File Upload: Users can upload MP3 files from their local storage or by providing a URL link.
Audio Preview: A built-in audio player allows users to preview the uploaded MP3 file and listen to the selection before cutting.
Visual Timeline/Track: Users can visualize the MP3 file on a timeline or wave representation to select the portion they want to cut.
Selection Tools: Users can define the start and end points of the cut either by dragging over the timeline or by specifying the time range manually.
Cutting Functionality: The selected portion of the audio is cut and saved as a separate MP3 file.
Download Feature: After cutting, the trimmed MP3 file can be downloaded by the user.
Backend Processing: The cutting and processing of the MP3 file may occur on the server-side (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.) or in the browser using JavaScript libraries like Web Audio API.
File Format Compatibility: Besides MP3, the project could potentially support multiple audio formats like WAV, OGG, etc.
Technologies Used:
Frontend:

HTML/CSS for the UI
JavaScript for dynamic interaction and audio handling
Libraries such as Web Audio API or Howler.js to manage audio playback and cutting
Bootstrap or other CSS frameworks for responsive design
